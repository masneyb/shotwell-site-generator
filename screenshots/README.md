The larger icons are rated 4 stars in Shotwell. Media that's rated 5 stars in
Shotwell takes up the whole screen width. (Not shown in this screenshot, however
is shown below on the desktop view.)

# Desktop Default View

If your browser's screen resolution is wide enough (> 1200 pixels), then the
larger icons are shown. You can change the icon size / styles by clicking on the
'Default Icons' dropdown.

# Desktop Smaller Icon View
 
![Desktop Small/Medium/Large View](desktop-small-medium-large-view-small.png?raw=1)

Three different icon sizes are shown. The largest icons are rated 5 stars in Shotwell.
The medium icons are rated 4 stars, and the smallest icons represent all remaining
media. This view was explicitly requested in the web UI via the dropdown. This is the
default view when viewing the generated website on a phone or tablet.
